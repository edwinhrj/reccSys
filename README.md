We processed a 9.4M Steam game review dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, refining it to a 700K interaction dataset. We then implemented both Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering techniques to build a video game recommendation system. Our pipeline includes various machine learning and deep learning models, structured as follows:

1) Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
2) Feature Engineering 
3) Sentence-BERT (Content-Based)
4) Stacked Logistic Regression (Content-Based)
5) Wide & Deep Learning Model (Hybrid)
6) Neural Collaborative Filtering (Collaborative-Filtering)
7) Light Graph Convolutional Network (Collaborative-Filtering)
8) Deep Cross Network (Collaborative-Filtering)
   
This project leverages traditional ML, deep learning, and graph-based models to improve recommendation accuracy by combining user preferences, game metadata, and review sentiment. ðŸš€
