We processed a 9.4M Steam game review dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, refining it to a 700K interaction dataset. In a team of four, we implemented both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to build a video game recommendation system. Our pipeline includes various machine learning and deep learning models, structured as follows:

1) Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
2) Feature Engineering 
3) Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for text embeddings 
4) Stacked Logistic Regression for hybrid recommendations 
5) Wide & Deep Learning Model (step5_Wide&Deep.ipynb)
6) Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) 
7) Light Graph Convolutional Network (LightGCN) 
8) Deep Cross Network (DeepCoNN) for review-based recommendations (step8_DeepCoNN.ipynb)
   
This project leverages traditional ML, deep learning, and graph-based models to improve recommendation accuracy by combining user preferences, game metadata, and review sentiment. ðŸš€
